# Lesko Help · Quick Guide Library

One searchable home for every Lesko Help quick guide and lesson that lives in the
[Lesko Help community](https://lesko-help-2.mn.co). Members can filter by topic
(Business, Nonprofit, Career, or everything), open a guide, download the PDF,
tick off the organizations they contacted, keep notes, bookmark the guides they
need, and ask the team for a new guide.

Everything a member does (bookmarks, notes, check-marks, requests) is stored in
their own browser. Nothing is sent anywhere. That matches the "100% private"
promise of the other Lesko Help apps.

## Run it

It is a static site. Open `index.html` in a browser, or serve the folder:

```
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

To host it, publish the repository root with GitHub Pages (or drop the folder on
any static host). No build step is needed for the site itself.

## Files

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `index.html` | The app shell: hero, tabs, library, my guides, request form, guide drawer |
| `assets/styles.css` | Lesko Help brand styling (cream ground, navy ink, suit colours, serif display, mono labels), light and dark themes |
| `assets/app.js` | Search, filters, sorting, bookmarks, done-state, notes, link check-marks, requests, deep links (`#guide/<id>`) |
| `libraries/*.json` | One settings file per library: title, topics with colour and icon, lesson numbers, Drive listing, optional `spaces` filter (business, taxes, families, health, bills, veterans) |
| `dist/<library>/index.html` | One self-contained app per library, the folder a Netlify site publishes |
| `data/guides.js` / `data/guides.json` | The generated catalogue (guides.js is the Business library for the root page) |
| `data/source/` | Raw export from the community: coursework manifest, per-space post details, Google Drive folder listing |
| `data/source/state_reports.json` | The state-by-state report index and the links extracted from each of the six reports per state |
| `scripts/merge_state_reports.py` | Merges the per-state extraction files into `data/source/state_reports.json` |
| `data/source/post_bodies.json` | The written content of every community lesson and quick guide, as structured blocks |
| `scripts/merge_post_bodies.py` | Merges the recovered post bodies and sanitises their markup down to links, bold and italics |
| `brand/` | The Lesko Help icons, one per library, inlined into the top bar at build time |
| `data/INVENTORY.md` | Human-readable inventory of every space, series and guide, including gaps and content issues |
| `scripts/build_data.py` | Rebuilds `data/guides.*` from `data/source/` |
| `scripts/build_single_file.py` | Inlines everything into `dist/index.html` for previews |

## Updating the catalogue

1. Re-export the community posts into `data/source/posts_*.json` (same shape as the existing files).
2. Update `data/source/drive_folder.json` if PDFs were added to the shared Google Drive folder.
3. Run `python3 scripts/build_data.py`.

Topic mapping (which community section lands in which topic chip) lives at the
top of `scripts/build_data.py`.

## Lesson text

Each community post carries written content: steps, tips, warnings and links.
`data/source/post_bodies.json` holds it as blocks (paragraph, heading, list,
steps, tip, warning, resources) with inline markup limited to links, bold and
italics. The viewer shows the video and that text together; the PDF, where there
is one, sits on its own tab.

## The state library

`libraries/states.json` is different from the others: it has no community space.
Each row is a US state, grouped into five regions, and the viewer shows a page of
links rather than a PDF. The content comes from the Lesko state index document,
which links six reports per state. `scripts/merge_state_reports.py` turns the
extracted links into `data/source/state_reports.json`, which `build_data.py` reads.

## Netlify

One site per library, all from this branch. Set the environment variable
`LIBRARY` to one of `business`, `taxes`, `families`, `health`, `bills`,
`veterans` or `states`, then trigger a deploy. Without it the build falls back
to `business`.

## Where requests go

The "Request a Guide" tab saves the request on the member's device and offers two
ways to send it: post it in the community Questions Channel (the text is copied
to the clipboard) or email the team. The channel link and email address are the
two constants at the top of `assets/app.js`.
